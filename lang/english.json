Find gray-colored rocks to gather the granite."
			],

			"modStarterQuestCrafting": [
				"Crafting",
				"To survive, you will need to craft new items from the resources you gather. Press {BINDINGS:DialogCrafting} to open the crafting window. It will show you what you can make from the items in your inventory. Start by making sharp granite which is used in many crafting recipes. Not every attempt to craft an item is successful, and the chance of success depends on the skill level of the item against your crafting skills.\n\nIf your crafting menu is too small, you can adjust it in size and position by dragging it around or dragging the corners to resize."

			"modStarterQuestDismantle": [
				"Dismantling",

A branch for example can be dismantled into twigs, leaves, stripped bark, and a wooden pole; a wealth of resources.\n\nDismantling items can be done through the crafting menu by clicking on the \"{/Dismantle/}\" tab. You will see a listing of items that can be dismantled. Hovering over each will show what they will be dismantled into. Alternatively, you can dismantle items using {BINDINGS:GameItemMenu} on them in your inventory and selecting \"{/Dismantle/}\"."

				"Hunting",
				"It's time to learn another important survival lesson: Hunting! Find a creature with meat and slay it. You can butcher its corpse after dealing the final blow, using a \"{/Sharpened/}\" item while facing it by using \"{/Butcher/}\" from the item's menu. You can also assign it to an action slot and use a bind to do this quicker. Creatures with some form of raw meat include giant rats, giant spiders, chickens, rabbits, and more."

			"modStarterQuestWoodenPoles": [
				"Wooden Poles",
				"You will need to start a fire to cook the raw meat if you want to eat it safely. Your first order of business is to gather the materials used to create your fire-making device. Dismantle enough branches or logs to get a least two \"{/Wooden Poles/}\"."

			"modStarterQuestHandDrill": [
				"Hand Drill",
				"At this point, you will have unlocked a new crafting recipe called \"{/Hand Drill/}\", a primitive and easy-to-craft device that makes fire. You unlock new crafting recipes by having one of each required items in your inventory. Go ahead and craft it!"

			"modStarterQuestKindlingTinder": [
				"Kindling & Tinder",
				"The final items needed to start a fire are kindling and tinder. Many items are considered kindling, such as twigs, tree bark, and wooden dowels (dismantled from wooden poles). Many items are also considered tinder, such as wooden shavings (dismantled from twigs or wooden dowels), animal fur, leaves, and more.\n\nCraft, dismantle, or find kindling and tinder!"
			],

			"modStarterQuestCampfire": [
				"Campfire",
				"You could technically start a fire at this moment. But to make a proper, enclosed fire-source, you'll want to make a \"{/Granite Campfire/}\". You'll need quite a few pieces of granite for this endeavor.\n\nWith some items, you will be able to build them and temporarily affix them to the world. These objects that are attached/placed on tiles, are called \"{/Doodads/}\". Using {BINDINGS:GameItemMenu} on the campfire in your inventory will give you the option to \"{/Build/}\" it. Do so now, facing a valid tile."
			],

			"modStarterQuestFire": [
				"Fire!",
				"With your hand drill, select the \"{/Start Fire/}\" option from the item's menu while facing the campfire. Doing so will create a fire contained inside of it. You don't always get lucky when making a fire with low camping skills. It's possible that you may need to re-gather and craft some more wooden shavings (or any other tinder item, such as, leaves, animal fur, or grass blades) and kindling if you fail too many times.\n\nBe careful not to step in your fire!"
			],

			"modStarterQuestStokeFire": [
				"Stoking Fire",
				"Your fire could probably use more fuel as well. To add fuel to a fire, use {BINDINGS:GameItemMenu} on an item and choose the \"{/Stoke Fire/}\" action. This action is available on many items, including logs, branches, and more.\n\nYou can check the status of the fire by hovering your mouse over it. If you have tool-tips disabled, you can also check the status by using {BINDINGS:GameInspect} while hovering over it."

			"modStarterQuestCooking": [
				"Cooking with Fire",
				"Now that you have a proper fire going, you can cook the meat! The crafting recipe will be unlocked for the cooked form of this meat. You can even eat it after you are done if you are hungry, or save it for later.\n\nCooking equipment may required for this endeavor. Cooking equipment is an item grouping that contains a wide variety of items including branches, wooden poles, spears, tongs, and more!"
			],

			"modStarterQuestWaterStill": [
				"Water Still",
				"Are you a bit parched? Time to think about water desalination for turning seawater into drinkable, clean water. Gather the following resources to be able to craft a \"{/Granite Water Still/}\".\n\nAfter gathering all those resources, you can craft the still. You'll use this device to pour the seawater into, boil and steam-drip the desalinated water into the container.\n\nJust like with the campfire previously, you'll be able to \"{/Build/}\" the water still facing a valid tile from the item's menu."
			],

			"modStarterQuestFillStill": [
				"Filling the Still",
				"To test out your new water still, grab some water from the ocean. With an empty container in your inventory, choose the \"{/Gather Water/}\" option while facing the ocean with your container.\n\nWhile still facing the water still, choose the \"{/Pour/}\" option from your container of seawater's item menu. This will pour the liquid into the water still."
			],

			"modStarterQuestAttachContainer": [
				"Attaching the Container",
				"\n\nWhile facing the water still, choose the \"{/Attach Container/}\" option from your container's item menu. This will attach the container to the still so the desalinated water can collect into it."
			],

			"modStarterQuestDesalination": [
				"Desalination",
				"You'll need to light a fire under the still so the water can begin to boil and steam the liquid inside. Which means you'll need to find or craft more tinder and kindling. Hopefully you still have durability on your hand drill as well. If not, you'll need to craft another one.\n\nAfter it's on fire, you'll want to stoke it so it is on fire long enough to desalinate the water. To stoke the still, face it and use {BINDINGS:GameItemMenu} on an item, then choose the \"{/Stoke Fire/}\" action. You will likely want to keep stoking the fire until it is at least \"struggling\". That will give it enough time to desalinate the water. You can check this status by hovering over the still after it is lit."
			],

			"modStarterQuestGatherLiquid": [
				"Gathering Water",
				"After it's on fire, you'll have to wait until the water container is filled before picking it up. You can do some other tasks while you wait. It will take approximately 250 turns before it is ready. The tooltip when hovering the water still will let you know when the water is ready to gather.\n\nWhen the process has completed, you can choose the \"{/Drink/}\" or \"{/Detach Container/}\" actions by pressing {BINDINGS:GameActions} while facing the still. Alternatively, if you have another container, you can choose the \"{/Gather Liquid/}\" option from the container's menu. \n\nYou will only need to complete a process such as this for drinking sea or ocean water. Note that desalination is an advanced technique and may not be needed if you have found freshwater sources. Freshwater can be gathered and purified over a fire, without a still."

			"modStarterQuestTaming": [
				"Creature Taming",
				"Have you encountered a hostile creature yet? Being counter-aggressive to the hostile island creatures is sometimes not the best option, especially if you are ill-prepared or ill-equipped. There's multiple ways to tame a creature. The most effective way to tame a creature and have it fight for you is to keep them fed and happy. To accomplish this, you can do one of the following actions:\n\n1. Facing a creature, choose the \"{/Offer/}\" from an item's menu. Certain creatures will like different items. You may have to experiment with this.\n2. Drop an item on the ground and have the creature walk over it. If they want the item, they will become tamed.\n3. Facing a creature, open the actions menu with {BINDINGS:GameActions} and choose \"{/Tame/}\". Taming in this manner is difficult, especially at lower skill levels."
			],

			"modStarterQuestExtraStorage": [
				"Extra Storage",
				"Feeling a bit heavy? You may want to start thinking about long-term storage that is outside of your inventory. The easiest storage container to craft is a \"{/Wooden Chest/}\". You will need to gather both logs and wooden dowels. To get wooden dowels, you will need to dismantle wooden poles, which are first dismantled from branches.\n\nIf you are looking for further weight reduction in your inventory, you may consider crafting bags or backpacks (using leather) to reduce inventory weight by 50% for all items that are kept inside them."
