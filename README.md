# Starter Quest

A guided quest for newer players to understand and discover the most important game mechanics in Wayward.

Available by default in the game (as an internal mod).

Note: When including a translated version of the Starter Quest in your language mod, make sure to merge it with the pre-existing "quest" and "questRequirement" object keys that are part of the base game.
